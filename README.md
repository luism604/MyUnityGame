One reason I picked this tutorial because it did not require the use of any assets. Another reason I chose the tutorial was the instructor. Most tutorials and instructors I came across assumed too much knowledge on the students' part, and glossed over many components, going way too fast. This instructor elaborately nicely on every single step.
There were no difficulties, although I ran into one issue with the prefabs that took me half an hour to fix. As it turns out, there were just some typos in the code. 
I learned many basic components of Unity, such as programming basic animation on in-game objects.
